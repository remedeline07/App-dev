The story behind the fight song

>Rachel Platten's hit "Fight Song" might be one of the biggest inspirational anthems of 2015, but the singer says she didn’t mean for anyone else to hear it at first — and she wasn’t sure if anybody ever would.

>"Ten months ago I was on a house concert tour in a van playing to like twenty or thirty people a night," Platten said in an interview for the ABC News special "The Year: 2015" hosted by ABC News' Robin Roberts. "I wrote the song when I was going through such a hard time and I needed to remember to believe in myself. ... So the fact that it's reached anyone other than me is really incredible."

>Platten said she spent nearly a decade trying to make a successful music career for herself, carrying her own keyboard and playing cover gigs and performances from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m., in New York City.

>"When I wrote 'Fight Song,' I was in a particular low point. I needed to remind myself to not give up, that I still believed in myself and that I still had fight left," Platten said. "I didn't intend to write ['Fight Song'], you know, for the world to hear to be honest. I wrote it 'cause I needed it. And I wrote it 'cause I needed that reminder and I needed hope. And maybe there was this tiny place in my heart that I believed this could still happen. And the fact that it did is crazy."
